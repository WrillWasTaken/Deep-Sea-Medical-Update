changelist

bugs:
EVERYTHING TARGETS CHARACTER INSTEAD OF USETARGET AAAAAAAAAAAAA - wip
surgical scissors not checking for organs properly - fixed (balance change included)
autosurgeon programs uncraftable (apparently a bug ... ?) - fixed
surgeon outfit sprite not updated for human resprite - fixed
3rd itemset not appearing - fixed




balancechanges:
ethertanks dont spawn in supplycab, increased spawn in medcabs instead and made craftable (1x choral hydrate, 1x aluminium)
organ damage harvesting threshold reduced to 1
surgeon itemset spawns with batterycell in autosurgeon
combatstim provides a hp boost instead of healing, overdose gives negative damage resistance (increased damage taken) which lets you keep alive on stims, but make them nonviable for prolonged combat

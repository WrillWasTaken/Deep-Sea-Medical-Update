balancechanges:
ethertanks dont spawn in supplycab, increased spawn in medcabs instead and made craftable (1x choral hydrate, 1x aluminium)
organ damage harvesting threshold reduced to 1
surgeon itemset spawns with batterycell in autosurgeon
combatstim provides a hp boost instead of healing, overdose gives negative damage resistance (increased damage taken) which lets you keep alive on stims, but make them nonviable for prolonged combat
